Hello on tetris-on-terminal, this readme is almost empty now,
but it will be fixed in future.

How to build / download / install / etc.

Step 1: download srces.
$ git clone https://github.com/cdkrot/tetris-on-terminal
$ cd tetris-on-terminal

Step 2: compile (you need to have modern enough g++ and ncurses lib)
$ ./build.sh

Step 3: run.
$ ./bin/tetris-on-terminal
